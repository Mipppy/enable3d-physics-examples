## Description
Web Physics is a physics simulation that runs at stable 30 frams in your web browser.  It has 5 built in geometeric shapes that you can place around on 3 different maps.  These geometeric shapes are
- Cube
- Sphere
- Cylinder
- Torus
- Cone
The maps are
- Default
- Mountain
- Slope
After selecting what shape you want to place, you can modify properties of the shape to create even more shapes!  You can turn cones in pyramids, spheres in diamonds, and so much more!  Your imagination is truly the limit for this.  

## How to run
Simply run
```bash
npm start
```
in the terminal
